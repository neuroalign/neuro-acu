# Code of Ethics

## International Association for Neuro Acupuncture

---

## Introduction

The International Association for Neuro Acupuncture (IANA) is committed to maintaining the highest professional standards within the field of neuro acupuncture. This Code of Ethics establishes the principles and standards of professional conduct expected of all IANA members.

The IANA recognises that members may practice various neuro acupuncture modalities, including but not limited to scalp acupuncture techniques such as the NeuroRelief Method, Yamamoto New Scalp Acupuncture (YNSA), Fang Yunpeng Scalp Acupuncture, and other evidence-based neuro acupuncture systems. Whilst the modalities and methodologies may differ, all IANA members are expected to adhere to the ethical principles outlined in this Code.

This Code of Ethics is distinct from the IANA Code of Safe Practice, which addresses operational, hygiene, safety, and equipment standards. Members must comply with both documents.

### Membership Categories

IANA recognises three membership categories:

**Full Members** must have completed at least 100 hours of training in neuro acupuncture from a recognised training provider. Full Members may practice clinically and are expected to adhere to all sections of this Code.

**Student Members** are enrolled on accredited neuro acupuncture training programmes involving at least 50 hours of training. Upon completion of at least 100 hours of training and meeting all other membership requirements, Student Members may apply for Full Membership. Student Members operate under specific conditions outlined in this Code.

**Training Provider Members** provide education in neuro acupuncture. Training Provider Membership is in addition to Full or Student Membership and requires individual assessment. Training Providers must maintain clinical practice in addition to their teaching role.

## 1. Your Duty of Care to Patients

### 1.1 Fundamental Principles

You have a primary duty of care to your patients and must maintain high standards of professional conduct, clinical competence, and integrity at all times. The relationship between you and your patient is one of professional trust, and you must not abuse this trust in any way.

Every patient consulting you has the right to expect that you will:

- Make their care and wellbeing your overriding priority.
- Listen carefully to their concerns and respect their confidentiality absolutely.
- Explain your findings clearly and ensure they understand what you tell them.
- Inform them clearly of the nature, purpose, and limitations of any proposed treatment.
- Respect their autonomy and encourage their freedom of choice.
- Ensure they know how and where to contact you, and what to do if they have concerns about their treatment.
- Treat them with dignity and respect, free from discrimination of any kind.

### 1.2 Clinical Assessment and Competence

In providing care, you must:

- Assess any patient's condition thoroughly, taking a comprehensive history and conducting appropriate examination relevant to your scope of practice.
- Recognise the limits of your professional competence and work strictly within them.
- Maintain and continuously develop your knowledge and skills in neuro acupuncture practice.
- Base your clinical practice on current, best available evidence.
- Provide, where appropriate and with the patient's informed consent, relevant information to other healthcare professionals involved in their care.
- Consult with others and refer for investigation or treatment elsewhere when necessary to the patient's wellbeing.
- Work collaboratively with other healthcare providers and respect the roles and expertise of medical doctors and other professionals.

### 1.3 Treatment Planning and Review

You must:

- Develop clear, evidence-informed treatment plans in consultation with your patient.
- Explain the expected duration and frequency of treatment, and review progress at agreed intervals.
- Assess the suitability of continued neuro acupuncture treatment at each review and adjust your approach based on patient response.
- Discontinue treatment if neuro acupuncture is no longer the most appropriate means of addressing the patient's condition, and promptly encourage the patient to seek alternative treatment or medical opinion.
- Be transparent with patients about realistic treatment outcomes based on current evidence. You must not make curative claims or offer guarantees about treatment results.
- Act promptly and appropriately if you become aware of an error in your practice, and ensure your professional indemnity insurers are informed.
- Respond promptly to any patient complaint and keep a dated record of the complaint and all actions taken.

---

## 2. Scope of Practice and Clinical Boundaries

### 2.1 Working Within Your Competence

Your scope of practice is determined by your training, competence, and experience. You must:

- Recognise the limits of your professional competence and only practice within them.
- Understand that scope of practice is not solely determined by your qualifications but by your ability to practice safely and effectively in a particular area.
- Continuously assess your competence and seek additional training or supervision if you wish to expand your scope of practice.
- Not delegate clinical decision-making to unqualified staff, though you may delegate specific tasks to appropriately trained and supervised practitioners.

### 2.2 Clinical Judgement and Referral

Whilst neuro acupuncture may be beneficial for many conditions, it is not appropriate for all patients or all presentations. You must:

- Exercise clinical judgement when assessing whether neuro acupuncture is an appropriate treatment modality for a particular patient.
- Refer patients to appropriate medical professionals when their condition is outside your scope of practice, when they require medical investigation or diagnosis, or when their condition may be critical or unresponsive to neuro acupuncture.
- Refuse treatment if you are uncertain about a patient's diagnosis, if they require urgent medical attention, or if you believe acupuncture is not in their best interests.
- Advise patients to seek medical attention if they present with signs or symptoms that may indicate serious underlying pathology.
- Not attempt to diagnose medical conditions, but communicate relevant clinical observations to the patient and, with their consent, to their medical practitioners.

### 2.3 Absolute Contraindications

You must **not** perform scalp acupuncture on patients presenting with any of the following absolute contraindications:

- Open wounds, infections, ulcers, or severe dermatitis on the scalp.
- Recent skull fracture, cranial surgery, or areas with missing bone.
- Uncontrolled severe hypertension (e.g., hypertensive crisis).
- Active bleeding disorders or uncontrolled anticoagulation (high bleeding risk).
- Open fontanelles or undeveloped skull bones in infants.
- Inability to safely cooperate (severe agitation, uncontrolled movements that pose safety risk).

### 2.4 Relative Contraindications

The following are relative contraindications requiring careful clinical judgement. You may proceed with treatment only after thorough assessment, informed patient consent, and appropriate modifications to your technique:

- Pregnancy, particularly with a history of miscarriage.
- Epilepsy or seizure disorders.
- Recent head trauma or acute-phase intracranial events.
- Immunosuppression, uncontrolled systemic illness, or significant frailty.
- Patients taking anticoagulants or antiplatelet medications (moderate bleeding risk).
- Recent scalp surgery, scarring, skin grafts, or previous radiation to the scalp.
- Young children where skull development is ongoing; particular caution in avoiding suture regions.
- Significant emotional instability or anxiety that may cause sudden, involuntary movement.

In each case, you must document your clinical reasoning and the patient's informed consent to proceed with treatment.

---

## 3. Your Legal and Ethical Obligations

### 3.1 Informed Consent

Informed consent is fundamental to ethical neuro acupuncture practice. You must:

- Explain the proposed treatment clearly, including the rationale, what the procedure involves, the expected duration and frequency, and any potential risks or side effects.
- Discuss the evidence base for the proposed treatment in language the patient understands.
- Ensure the patient has opportunity to ask questions and that you answer these fully and honestly.
- Obtain explicit, documented consent before commencing any treatment. Implied consent (e.g., a patient simply lying on a treatment couch) is insufficient.
- Recognise that a patient is entitled to refuse or withdraw from treatment at any time, and respect this decision without coercion or pressure.
- Be aware that proceeding with treatment without consent, or continuing treatment after a patient has withdrawn consent, may constitute assault and is a serious breach of professional ethics.
- Record all relevant information about the consent process in the patient's case notes.

### 3.2 Consent for Minors

For patients under 18 years of age, you must:

- Obtain explicit consent from a parent or legally authorised guardian before offering any treatment.
- Refuse treatment in the absence of parental or guardian consent.
- Recognise that a young person's refusal of treatment may carry legal force and override parental consent, depending on their age and maturity. If in doubt, seek legal advice or guidance from the IANA.
- Ensure a parent or legally authorised guardian is present throughout the entire examination and treatment. No other person may deputise for this role without explicit written consent from the parent or guardian.

### 3.3 Confidentiality

Confidentiality is a cornerstone of professional practice and patient trust. You must:

- Keep all information concerning your patients—medical, personal, or otherwise—entirely confidential.
- Extend this duty of confidentiality to all staff employed in your practice.
- Not disclose any information about a patient without their explicit, informed consent, even to their partner, relatives, or other healthcare providers.
- Regard the fact of a patient's attendance at your practice as confidential information.
- Maintain this duty of confidentiality even after the patient has ceased treatment or after their death.
- Keep patient records secure, whether held in physical or digital form, and ensure appropriate data protection measures are in place.
- Comply with all relevant data protection legislation in your jurisdiction.

### 3.4 Disclosure Without Consent

In rare circumstances, you may be justified in disclosing confidential information without a patient's consent if there is a serious public interest concern. This may include situations where:

- A patient poses a serious risk of harm to themselves or others.
- There is suspicion of child abuse or safeguarding concerns involving minors.
- A patient is failing to report a notifiable disease.
- A court orders disclosure as part of legal proceedings.

Before making any disclosure without consent, you must carefully consider whether this is genuinely in the public interest. You are advised to seek guidance from the IANA, or take legal advice, and check your local laws before proceeding. Privacy and disclosure laws vary significantly across countries and jurisdictions, so you must ensure you understand your legal obligations in your location of practice.

## 4. Your Obligations to Patients: Treatment and Communication

### 4.1 Fees and Charges

You must:

- Be transparent about fees and charges. Fees must be prominently displayed in your clinic or on your website before any patient engages your services.
- Make clear what each fee covers, distinguishing between initial consultation fees and subsequent treatment fees.
- Not overcharge patients or pressure them into prolonged treatment courses without demonstrable benefit.
- Not sell treatment packages containing 10 or more sessions, unless the patient has already received at least 3 treatments from you and is responding well to treatment, and there are clear, documented clinical indications that demonstrate 10 or more treatments are necessary. The IANA has the authority to use various measures to enforce this rule.
- Avoid financial conflicts of interest. If you recommend or sell products or services to patients, you must be satisfied this is genuinely for their benefit, not solely for your financial gain.
- Declare any financial interest you have in products or services before recommending them to patients.
- Not encourage patients to give, lend, or bequeath money or gifts for your personal benefit.

### 4.2 Clarity About Modality and Treatment Approach

Given that IANA members may practice different neuro acupuncture modalities, you must:

- Be clear with patients about the specific modality or approach you are trained in and will be using in their treatment.
- Explain what the chosen modality is and what evidence supports its use.
- Not misrepresent your qualifications or training. If you are trained in multiple neuro acupuncture systems, you must be explicit about which system(s) you are using and ensure patients understand this.
- Provide clear information if you combine neuro acupuncture with other therapeutic approaches (e.g., distal acupuncture, herbal medicine, other therapies), and ensure you have appropriate training and insurance for any adjunctive techniques.

### 4.3 Managing Patient Expectations

You must:

- Be realistic about treatment outcomes and base your communication on best available evidence for the patient's particular condition.
- Avoid making curative claims or offering guarantees about treatment results.
- Explain that treatment outcomes vary between individuals and that some patients may not respond as hoped.
- Discuss with patients the realistic timeframe for assessing treatment effectiveness and review progress at agreed intervals.
- Inform patients of alternative treatment options, including the option of medical consultation, rather than implying that neuro acupuncture is the only or definitive solution to their problem.

## 5. Professional Boundaries with Patients

### 5.1 Appropriate Professional Relationships

You must:

- Maintain professional boundaries at all times in your interactions with patients.
- Be aware of the inherent power imbalance in the practitioner–patient relationship and not exploit this.
- Ensure your behaviour is professional, dignified, and not open to misunderstanding or misinterpretation.
- Avoid non-physical behaviour, gesture, verbal suggestion, or innuendo that could reasonably be construed as inappropriate, abusive, or harassing.

### 5.2 Inappropriate Relationships—Sexual and Emotional

You must:

- Never enter into a sexual relationship with a patient.
- Be aware of the dangers of allowing any emotional relationship to develop with a patient that goes beyond the bounds of professional care.
- If you become aware that you are becoming emotionally or sexually involved with a patient, you must end the professional relationship and recommend that the patient seeks treatment from another practitioner.
- If a patient shows signs of becoming inappropriately involved with you, you should discourage this firmly and, if necessary, end the professional relationship.
- You may wish to report such matters to the IANA in your own interest, or seek confidential advice from a colleague.

### 5.3 Patient Modesty and Privacy

You must:

- Respect your patient's modesty and privacy at all times.
- Ensure that patients understand that neuro acupuncture techniques (scalp acupuncture) require access to the scalp only and do not necessitate removal of clothing.
- Only ask a patient to remove or adjust clothing if other therapeutic modalities are being used in conjunction with neuro acupuncture. In such cases, you must clearly explain to the patient why removal of clothing is necessary and obtain their explicit consent.
- Provide privacy for patients to dress and undress, and provide appropriate clean gowns or blankets if required.
- Not expose patients for longer than necessary during treatment.
- The IANA does not permit treatment of sensitive or intimate areas of the body under any circumstances.
- Always respect a patient's right to have another person present during treatment. A patient may request that a partner, family member, friend, or colleague be present, and you must accommodate this request without question or delay.

### 5.4 Treating Friends and Relatives

You may treat friends or relatives, provided that:

- Clear professional boundaries are maintained between the social and professional relationships.
- The patient receives the same standard of care as any other patient.
- Confidentiality is maintained, and professional records are kept as for any patient.
- The professional relationship takes precedence over the personal relationship.
- You comply with all local laws and regulations regarding proper documentation and record-keeping.

- Compliant with relevant advertising standards in your jurisdiction.
- Free from misleading or deceptive claims.
- Not sensational, self-laudatory, or extravagant.
- Not creating unjustified expectations about treatment duration, type, or prospects for relieving the patient's condition.

You must:

- Not disparage professional colleagues or other healthcare professionals in your marketing.
- Not use false or misleading credentials, and be clear about the specific qualifications and training you hold.
- Be clear about the specific neuro acupuncture modality or system you practice.
- Ensure advertising appears in surroundings appropriate to professional practice and is distributed through professional channels.
- Not use IANA logos or certification marks in advertising without explicit written authorisation from the IANA.

### 6.2 Avoiding Conflicts of Interest

You must:

- Make a clear distinction between your neuro acupuncture practice and any other commercial activities in which you may be involved.
- Ensure that commercial or business matters do not influence your attitude towards patients' care or your clinical decision-making.
- Avoid situations where financial incentive might compromise your clinical judgement.
- Be transparent with patients about any financial interests you have in products or services you recommend.

            <h2>What is Neuro Acupuncture?</h2>
            <p>Neuro acupuncture represents a specialised approach to acupuncture that focuses on modulating brain and nervous system function to address neurological conditions, chronic pain, and functional limitations. Rather than treating local symptoms in isolation, neuro acupuncture uses precise, evidence-informed techniques—particularly scalp acupuncture—to influence central nervous system activity and promote functional recovery.</p>
            <p>The field of neuro acupuncture has evolved significantly over recent decades, drawing on both traditional acupuncture principles and contemporary neuroscience. However, the lack of unified professional standards, inconsistent training quality, and limited awareness of neuro acupuncture's clinical potential have historically hindered its recognition and integration into mainstream healthcare. The International Association for Neuro Acupuncture (IANA) exists to address these gaps: establishing internationally recognised professional standards, accrediting high-quality training programmes, and advancing evidence-based practice to ensure that patients receive safe, effective, and consistent care from qualified practitioners.</p>

            <h2>Conditions Treated with Neuro Acupuncture</h2>
            <p>Neuro acupuncture encompasses specialised techniques for treating a wide range of neurological conditions and symptoms. By modulating nervous system function, neuro acupuncture can help reduce symptoms, improve functional recovery, and enhance quality of life across diverse presentations:</p>

            <div class="cards-grid">
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Stroke Recovery</h3>
                    <p>Following a stroke, patients often experience motor weakness, speech difficulties, and functional limitations. Neuro acupuncture techniques can help facilitate motor recovery, improve coordination, and support functional restoration through targeted nervous system stimulation.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Movement Disorders</h3>
                    <p>Conditions such as Parkinson's disease result in movement difficulties, tremor, and loss of motor control. Neuro acupuncture can help reduce tremor, improve movement initiation, and enhance overall motor function and stability.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Chronic Pain</h3>
                    <p>Chronic pain—including musculoskeletal pain and neuropathic conditions—often involves altered pain processing in the brain. Neuro acupuncture modulates pain signalling pathways, offering lasting relief by addressing the neurological basis of pain rather than local symptoms alone.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Migraine & Headaches</h3>
                    <p>Migraine and chronic headaches involve dysregulation of neural pathways controlling pain and inflammation. Neuro acupuncture can reduce migraine frequency and intensity by rebalancing nervous system function and reducing neural hyperexcitability.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Multiple Sclerosis</h3>
                    <p>Multiple sclerosis affects diverse nervous system functions, causing fatigue, spasticity, sensory disturbances, and mobility limitations. Neuro acupuncture can help manage these symptoms and support functional independence through nervous system modulation.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Neurological Rehabilitation</h3>
                    <p>Traumatic brain injury, peripheral neuropathy, balance disorders, and cognitive difficulties benefit from neuro acupuncture's capacity to promote neural plasticity, restore function, and support recovery across multiple neurological systems.</p>
